Name is system recommended. I want a B/S help system easily managing test cases for test teams. 
Test cases are hosted in a repository. Different versions of product share most of them, but modify some. Assuming test cases are numerous. We only store and trace the difference from version to the next. From web page, users see the whole verion which could add, edit or delete test case.
